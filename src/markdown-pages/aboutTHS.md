**THS** (_Tekniska Högskolans Studentkår_, the Student Union at KTH) is our parent organization. They are responsible for ensuring educational quality and student welfare, as well as organizing social and career-oriented events. 

THS also has its own building called Nymble, where you can find a cafe, restaurant, bookstore, event and study spaces, and so much more!

THS also has seveal student associations and Chapters (study field-specific associations), which can be found [here](https://ths.kth.se/en/list). 

## What Goes on at THS?

In order to explain this, it is probably best to talk about the three major bodies of decision-makers at THS.

The THS Union Council (_THS kårfullmäktige, KF_) are elected representatives from the Chapters and serve as the decision-makers. 

The THS Union Board (_Kårstyrelsen, KS_) work on the long-term development of THS.  These positions are elected at the end of the year by  KF and are joined by the President and Vice President in the THS Management Team. The Union Board has Board Meetings (KSm) about 10-15 times per year, in which all THS members can attend. 

The THS Management Team (_Kårledningen, KL_). They are elected by KS, and are either elected in the fall or spring terms. They take one year off of their studies to work for the student union in a specific area ex. business relations, social and international relations, education affairs, etc. 

More info can be found on the THS website!

## Becoming a THS Member

There are various reasons for becoming a THS member, which can be found [here](https://ths.kth.se/en/membership).

Just as a reminder, as a participant of the THS International Reception, you **do not** need to be a member of THS. 

In order to become a student member of THS, you need to have an active course registration at KTH. If you are only admitted to a course/program, but not registered, then it is not sufficient. You can check your registrations here.
