## Becoming a THS Member

There are various perks of becoming a THS member, but please check out their website below to figure out what those are. 

In order to become a student member of THS, you need to have an active course registration at KTH. If you are only admitted to a course/program, but not registered, then it is not sufficient. You can check your registrations here.
