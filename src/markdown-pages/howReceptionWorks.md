## Fall 2020 Reception

The THS International Reception uses our own sign up system, built by our amazing IT Team, where our new students can view all of our events and be able to book them. 

This year's THS International Reception is a special one, where we have limited the number of spots for each event significantly in comparison to previous years.  We have grouped events into the following categories:

* Category A: Students are allowed to sign up for a **maximum of 6 events**.
* Category B: Students are allowed to sign up for as many events as they wish.

Our events are popular amongst students, but please keep in mind that there **may be spots that open up suddenly**. If a student does not show up to a payment  desk after being reminded to attend it, we will remove them from our event list and open the spot up for new students. Also, students may decide to unregister for events due to other commitments. 

Please keep in mind that if you cannot attend one of our events, you will be able to unregister from the event at the latest two days before the event's start date. If you suddenly cannot make the event, please contact us so that we can remove you from our system. Also, if your event requires a payment, please attend one of our payment desks. There will be payment desks on August 1st and August 15th, but we will also announce some additional onces in our Facebook group.
