  First of all, we would like to welcome to Project Team! The Project Managers
  recruited and interviewed their Project Team and it feels like family already!
  Due to the COVID-19 situation, we have not yet been able to physically meet
  each other, but instead we have met up every week via Zoom to go through each
  position's progress. After the weekly team meetings, we get a chance to bond
  through playing games via Zoom! \

  But most importantly, the Project Team has been planning the upcoming
  Reception! We have been working with our collaborating THS/KTH organizations
  to get a wide range of events suiting many different interests. We are still
  in the process of finalizing the calendar, but we are excited to share this
  within the next few months!
