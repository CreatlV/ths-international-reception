  Buddy Applications are live! 


  Do you want to be part of welcoming new international students to KTH? Apply
  to be one of our Spring 2021 Buddies! Buddies are responsible for helping out
  at our events and hosting activities with their Buddy Group, a smaller group
  of new incoming students.


  Sounds like something for you?


  Notify your interest here: bit.ly/BuddyVT21\

  Deadline: Sat, Nov 14 at 23.59


  More info can be found in the interest form! We will also be hosting a Zoom
  Buddy info session in which you as an interested applicant can hear about the
  project and ask your questions. It will take place on Wednesday, November 11th
  at 18.00 at bit.ly/VT21Zoom !
