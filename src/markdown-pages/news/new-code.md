  What? How did one week fly by so fast? 


  Week 1 of Spring 2020 Reception is over and we are having a blast! Check out
  this post for more info about this week.


  We've had 17 events this week! We started first of with checking in the new
  students at Arrival Day on Tuesday and then in the evening had Board Games,
  Waffles, and Mario Kart. On Wednesday, the new students got to meet their
  Buddies at the Buddy Meeting, followed by a Sustainability Workshop with
  Students for Sustainability and Cooking Night 1. On Thursday, we had our fun
  Campus Treasure Hunt and amazing Pub Crawl in Vasastan. Our future-themed
  Gasque was followed by an afterparty on Friday. This weekend we had our Fika
  Crawl, Ikea Tour, Osqvik 1, Movie Night, Hiking with KTH Outdoor Club, Skansen
  1, Natural History Museum Scavenger Hunt, and Sauna event.
