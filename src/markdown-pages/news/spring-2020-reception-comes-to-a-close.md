  The Spring 2020 Reception has officially ended. We would like to take this
  chance to thank everyone who helped out during this time. 


  First of all, we would like to thank our amazing Buddies. We could not have
  been happier to have such wonderful, enthusiastic Buddies who were ready to
  help out at every event and make sure that all of the students felt welcomed
  to KTH. We could not have done it without each and every one of you. Thank you
  so much!


  Secondly, we thank our wonderful collaborators this Reception period. Thank
  you to Students for Sustainability, KTH Outdoor Club, KTH Dance, and our
  Chapter International Group collaborators (S, E&MiT, and M). We also thank the
  photographers Paul from Marknadsföringsgruppen and Hari for capturing all of
  the special moments from the Reception. Thank you PQ and Osqstämman for your
  great performances at the Banquet. Thanks Platoon DJ's, RN, and NKM for
  working with us during all of our big festive events. Furthermore, thank you
  to THS as a whole for your help.


  Finally, thank you to the Project Team and the Project Managers for your hard
  work. They have all been working on making this Reception happen prior to
  October. We are truly greatful to have you leading this Reception!
