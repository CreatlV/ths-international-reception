          If you have problems registering yourself in our sign up system,
          please try the following things:


          1. Reload the page several times. The page looks correct if you also
          have a drop down menu where you can select your field of study. Wait
          up to 30 seconds after loading the page, sometimes the drop down menu
          shows up after a few seconds.

          2. Use a different web browser


          If it still is not working try this:


          1. Do not use add ons

          2. Do not use vpn

          3. Do not use script blocker

          4. Do not use ad blockers
