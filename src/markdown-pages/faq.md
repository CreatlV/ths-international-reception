          Most of the events are only for new masters and international
          students, since we cannot accomodate more people due to space and
          budget. 


          However, there are a few parties open to the public so follow the [THS
          International Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/thsint/) for
          updates as this is where we will post info about our public events!

          You can find the Reception rules [here](bit.ly/RulesIntRecFall2020).

          We do not have any planned additional wristband handout/payment desk
          days, but stay tuned in the Facebook group to see if there are any
          announced days.

          Usually one or two days before the event you will receive an e-mail
          from us. This one is sent to the e-mail address you used in our signup
          system. Please check your spam folder as well, sometimes it goes in
          there.

          We put the health and safety of our students and community first. We
          do not know exactly how this situation will impact our Reception, but
          we have alternative plans and are willing to adjust to the situation
          in accordance to the information provided by THS, KTH, and the Swedish
          Health Institute.

    questions:
      - description: >-
          If you have problems registering yourself in our sign up system,
          please try the following things:


          1. Reload the page several times. The page looks correct if you also
          have a drop down menu where you can select your field of study. Wait
          up to 30 seconds after loading the page, sometimes the drop down menu
          shows up after a few seconds.

          2. Use a different web browser


          If it still is not working try this:


          1. Do not use add ons

          2. Do not use vpn

          3. Do not use script blocker

          4. Do not use ad blockers
        title: My register button doesn't work! What do I do?
      - description: >-
          Contact info@thsint.se or the Facebook Page “THS International”. We
          can fix it for you. Please do that soon because this will determine
          your Buddy Group.

  - category: Event Sign Up
    questions:
      - description: >-
          This is to be determined! If you are a new masters or international
          student, we will let you know! But hopefully in July!
        title: 'When will the event calendar be released? '
      - description: >-
          Currently, we are working on finalizing our event calendar. More
          information will come, but hopefully by July for the Fall 2020
          Reception!
        title: When will I be able to sign up for events?
      - description: >-
          We recommend to check the sign up page frequently since some students
          will unregister themselves from some events. As soon as someone
          unregisters, their spot becomes open in the system. Out of experience
          the closer it comes to the event the more people change their activity
          plans, but keep in mind that you usually can only unregister yourself
          two days before an event. **Please note that if you have already paid
          for an event there will be no refund.** 


          You cannot join a full event, regardless of your motivation for it.
          The event limitations are in place due to restrictions in the size of
          the event location, available material (like food) and our own
          organisational capacity. If you join a full event without our explicit
          consent, we will remove you from the event. In severe cases we ban you
          from attending further events in the Reception.
        title: The event I wanted to attend is full. What can I do?
      - description: >-
          We do not have a waiting list system yet (currently in the planning
          phase). Therefore, we recommend to check the sign up system regularly
          for open spots.
        title: Can you put me on a waiting list for a specific event?
      - description: >-
          Unfortunately this is not possible. We are aware that some events are
          very popular among new students but we cannot add more events. This is
          due to limitations in funding, the amount of people helping out, fire
          safety, booking of facilities, etc... Therefore, we are not able to
          offer more events than what we have right now in our event calendar :(
          Sometimes we might find a few more spots. In that case we will add
          them in the sign up system.
        title: >-
          Can you organize additional events, e.g. another gasque, hiking or
          Osqvik?

          If you are unsure what Chapter you belong, you can check
          [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRBIcNbmG1vW0L47mWMuLZHwui7QHFuIz8RlkTrKtgIUh21nwcyDRdkFi56i1O2j1EvkmFlEqJ4yw0i/pubhtml).
        title: What’s my Chapter?
      - description: >-
          This only applies to people who belong to the following Chapters. If
          your Chapter is not listed below, it means that they have no
          cooperation with us and to our knowledge no events are offered for
          you.


          If you are unsure what Chapter you belong, you can check
          [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRBIcNbmG1vW0L47mWMuLZHwui7QHFuIz8RlkTrKtgIUh21nwcyDRdkFi56i1O2j1EvkmFlEqJ4yw0i/pubhtml). 


          If you cannot see your Chapter events, it means that you have
          registered with the wrong field of study. Please contact our Facebook
          Page or write <mailto:info@thsint.se> so we can correct that.
        title: Why can’t I see events from my Chapter?
  - category: THS Membership and Student Card
    questions:
      - description: >-
          In order to become a student member of THS, you need to have an active
          course registration at KTH. If you are only admitted to a
          course/program, but not registered, then it is not sufficient. You can
          check your registrations
          [here](https://www.student.ladok.se/student/#/aktuell). You can pay
          the membership fee [here](https://ths.kth.se/login) or at
          [KårX](https://ths.kth.se/contact/student-union-office) (Student Union
          Office). You cannot sign up for membership in advance.
        title: How do I become a THS Member?
      - description: >-
          Every active student at KTH is entitled to a student card. This card
          proves that you are a student at KTH, and also gives you right to some
          discounts at different stores. The student card is often referred to
          as the Mecenat card, named after the company providing the card.


          More detailed information can be found
          [here](https://ths.kth.se/en/membership/student-card)
        title: What is the Student Card?
      - description: >-
          Please use your student id number that you have received in your
          email, together with your temporary personal number to sign in to the
          Mecenat app for your phone. You can sign up using any email and
          password you wish.


          **No email from Mecenat?**


          The reason why you have not yet received an email from Mecenat with
          your student ID number is because you do not have any contact
          information to your KTH profile. Before you add this information,
          there will be no card created for you, and they will have no way of
          sending any information to you. It usually takes a few days for KTH to
          send the updated information to Mecenat. You can check it here.

          transportation or call a taxi.
