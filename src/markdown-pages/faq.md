      - description: We use our own sign up system!
        title: How do I sign up for the events?
      - description: >-
          We are responsible for new to KTH masters, exchange, and international
          bachelor's students. We cannot accomodate more people due to space and
          budget. That inclues guests of those who are eligible to participate,
          such as significant others, friends, or parents. 


          Please note, you **do not** need to be a THS member to attend our
          events. THS is our central Student Union, and we are a project group
          within the Student Union, similar to a THS association. 


          We organize these events for our new students, so as long as you are
          attending KTH and fall into one of our responsible study programs,
          then you are allowed to attend!
        title: 'Who can attend the THS International Reception? '
      - description: >-
          THS is the Student Union at KTH. More info about them can be found
          [here](https://ths.kth.se).


          We have one member of our team, the Head of Social and International
          Relations at THS, who is part of the THS Management Team and takes off
          one of year of their studies to work for the Student Union. This role
          is responsible for recruiting the Project Managers for the THS
          International Reception. 


          The THS International Reception is a student-run project group within
          THS that organizes the welcome reception for our set of students. The
          Project Team consists of student volunteers.

          You can find the Fall 2020 Reception rules
          [here](https://bit.ly/RulesIntRecFall2020). By using our signup system
          and participating in Reception events you automatically agree to these
          rules.
        title: What rules do I have to follow for the Reception?
      - description: >-
          Your Buddy will contact you soon if they have not already! Depending
          on when you registered as a new student in our sign up system, you
          will receive a Buddy. 


          They will be leading the Buddy Meetings, which is a small group of new
          students in similar study fields.
        title: When do I get my Buddy?

          We put the health and safety of our students and community first. We
          do not know exactly how this situation will impact our Reception, but
          we have alternative plans and are willing to adjust to the situation
          in accordance to the information provided by THS, KTH, and the Swedish
          Health Institute.
        title: >-
          How are you planning the Reception amidst the ongoing COVID-19
          pandemic?
      - description: >-

    questions:
      - description: >-

          please try the following things:

          shows up after a few seconds.

  - category: Event Sign Up
    questions:
      - description: It has been to our new students!
        title: 'When will the event calendar be released? '
      - description: >-
          Event sign ups are open! Keep in mind that registration for the events
          will close ~2 days before the event starts.
        title: When will I be able to sign up for events?
      - description: >-
          We recommend to check the sign up page frequently since some students
          will unregister themselves from some events. As soon as someone
          unregisters, their spot becomes open in the system. Out of experience
          the closer it comes to the event the more people change their activity
          plans, but keep in mind that you usually can only unregister yourself
          two days before an event. 


          You cannot join a full event, regardless of your motivation for it.
          The event limitations are in place due to restrictions in the size of
          the event location, available material (like food) and our own
          organisational capacity. If you join a full event without our explicit
          consent, we will remove you from the event. In severe cases we ban you
          from attending further events in the Reception.
        title: The event I wanted to attend is full. What can I do?
      - description: >-
          We do not have a waiting list system yet, but this is currently in the
          planning phase. Therefore, we recommend to check the sign up system
          regularly for open spots.


          Hopefully in future Receptions we will be able to have a waiting list!
        title: Can you put me on a waiting list for a specific event?
      - description: >-
          Unfortunately this is not possible. We are aware that some events are
          very popular among new students but we cannot add more events. This is
          due to limitations in funding, the amount of people helping out, fire
          safety, booking of facilities, etc... Therefore, we are not able to
          offer more events than what we have right now in our event calendar!
        title: >-
          Can you organize additional events, e.g. another gasque, hiking or
          Osqvik?
      - description: >-
          Yes! If you want to swap events or give your spot to another new
          student, please have both of you email us at info@thsint.se with the
          name of the person and the event. Please wait for confirmation from
          us. 


          This needs to be conducted at least one day before the event.

          If you are unsure what Chapter you belong, you can check

        title: What’s my Chapter?
      - description: >-
          This only applies to people who belong to the following Chapters:
          Data&Media, E&MiT, F, M, IN, S, and W. Please read the entire event
          description before signing up. 


          If your Chapter is not listed above, it means that your Chapter is not
          collaborating with us this Reception, and to our knowledge no events
          are offered for you. 


          If you are unsure what Chapter you belong, you can check
          [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRBIcNbmG1vW0L47mWMuLZHwui7QHFuIz8RlkTrKtgIUh21nwcyDRdkFi56i1O2j1EvkmFlEqJ4yw0i/pubhtml). 


          Also check to see what study field you have registered to.

  - category: Payment for Events
    questions:
      - description: >-
          Yes, but not all events. These are marked in the bottom of our event
          description as well as on our sign up page. \

          \

          If an event requires a payment, please attend the payment desk on one
          of our Arrival Days. We will have other payment desks during the
          Reception, but these will be announced on our Facebook group a few
          days before they are held.
        title: 'Do some events require payment? '
      - description: >-
          In the calendars that we have below, we have some of the prices marked
          as Price X/Price Y, showcasing the non-alcoholic/alcoholic ticket
          price. In our sign up system, all prices will be marked as the
          non-alcoholic ticket. For the events titled Gasque, Osqvik, and Sauna
          Night, we will ask you at our payment desk if you would like to pay an
          additional fee for a ticket with alcohol.
        title: What do Price X/Price Y mean in the event calendar?
      - description: >-
          We do not have any planned payment desk days, but stay tuned in the
          Facebook group to see if there are any announced days.
        title: >-
          I don’t arrive on an Arrival Day. Where can I pay for my events that
          have a fee?
      - description: >-
          Yes you can, but we will need email confirmation from both the buyer
          and the seller that you would like to do a ticket swap. Please both of
          you email info@thsint.se, 24 hours before your event's start time. 


          You can post in our Facebook group to see if anyone would like to take
          your ticket. 


          Do not pay the seller until **after** you have gotten email
          confirmation from us. We check the lists to make sure that the buyer
          and the seller are both part of our student list! 


          Also the price must be the same amount as our own prices. In other
          words, you are not allowed to make profit off our tickets.

    questions:
      - description: 'Yes, we will not accept any drop-ins.'
        title: Do I have to have signed up to the event to attend?
      - description: >-
          Usually one or two days before the event you will receive an e-mail
          from us. This one is sent to the e-mail address you used in our signup
          system. Please check your spam folder as well, sometimes it goes in
          there.

          from us. This one is sent to the e-mail address you used in our signup
          system. Please check your spam folder as well, sometimes it goes in
          there. If you really can’t find it, contact us.

  - category: THS Membership and Student Card
    questions:
      - description: >-
          In order to become a student member of THS, you need to have an active
          course registration at KTH. If you are only admitted to a
          course/program, but not registered, then it is not sufficient. You can
          check your registrations
          [here](https://www.student.ladok.se/student/#/aktuell). You can pay
          the membership fee [here](https://ths.kth.se/login) or at
          [KårX](https://ths.kth.se/contact/student-union-office) (Student Union
          Office). You cannot sign up for membership in advances.
        title: How do I become a THS Member?
      - description: >-
          Every active student at KTH is entitled to a student card. This card
          proves that you are a student at KTH, and also gives you right to some
          discounts at different stores. The student card is often referred to
          as the Mecenat card, named after the company providing the card.


          More detailed information can be found
          [here](https://ths.kth.se/en/membership/student-card)
        title: What is the Student Card?
      - description: >-
          Please use your student id number that you have received in your
          email, together with your temporary personal number to sign in to the
          Mecenat app for your phone. You can sign up using any email and
          password you wish.


          **No email from Mecenat?**


          The reason why you have not yet received an email from Mecenat with
          your student ID number is because you do not have any contact
          information to your KTH profile. Before you add this information,
          there will be no card created for you, and they will have no way of
          sending any information to you. It usually takes a few days for KTH to
          send the updated information to Mecenat. You can check for more info
          here
          [here](https://www.kth.se/en/student/studentliv/studentlegitimation/legitimation-1.64343).
