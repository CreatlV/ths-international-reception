          If you have problems registering yourself in our sign up system,
          please try the following things:


          1. Reload the page several times. The page looks correct if you also
          have a drop down menu where you can select your field of study. Wait
          up to 30 seconds after loading the page, sometimes the drop down menu
          shows up after a few seconds.

          2. Use a different web browser


          If it still is not working try this:


          1. Do not use add ons

          2. Do not use vpn

          3. Do not use script blocker

          4. Do not use ad blockers

    questions:

          We recommend to check the sign up page frequently since some students
          will unregister themselves from some events. As soon as someone
          unregisters themselves their spot becomes open in the system. Out of
          experience the closer it comes to the event the more people change
          their activity plans, but keep in mind that you usually can only
          unregister yourself two days before an event. Please note that if you
          have already paid for an event there will be no refund. 




          You cannot join a full event, regardless of your motivation for it.
          The event limitations are in place due to restrictions in the size of
          the event location, available material (like food) and our own
          organisational capacity. If you join a full event without our explicit
          consent, we will remove you from the event. In severe cases we ban you
          from attending further events in the reception.

          We do not have a waiting list system yet (currently in the planning
          phase). Therefore, we recommend to check the sign up system regularly
          for open spots.
        title: Can you put me on a waiting list for a specific event?
      - description: >-
          Unfortunately this is not possible. We are aware that some events are
          very popular among new students but we cannot add more events. This is
          due to limitations in funding, the amount of people helping out, fire
          safety, booking of facilities, etc... Therefore, we are not able to
          offer more events than what we have right now in our event calendar :(
          Sometimes we might find a few more spots. In that case we will add
          them in the sign up system.

          Can you organize additional events, e.g. another Gasque, Hiking or
          Osqvik?

          This only applies to people who belong to the following chapters. If
          your chapter is not listed below, it means that they have no
          cooperation with us and to our knowledge no events are offered for
          you: 


          Elektrosektionen/Electrical Chapter (E)


          Medicinsk Teknik/ Medical Engineering Section (MiT)


          Masikteknik (M)


          Samhällsbyggnad (S)


          If you are unsure what chapter you belong, you can check here. 


          If you cannot see your chapter events, it means that you have
          registered with the wrong field of study. Please contact our Facebook
          Page or write info@thsint.se so we can correct that.
