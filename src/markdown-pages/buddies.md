Do you like welcoming new students? Want to share your amazing expertise on living in Sweden? Even better, yearning to join an amazing crew of enthusiastic volunteers? Join our Buddy team at the THS International Reception! We at the THS International Reception look for a bunch of diverse, welcoming students to help at all of our Reception festivities. 

Our Buddies are our wonderful, irreplaceable volunteers who help out during Reception. They volunteer at all of our events, but also serve as leaders for smaller Buddy Groups during Reception. Roles at the events can include anything from preparing food for our gasques, leading students to IKEA, assisting at check in during Arrival Day, holding bar shifts at our parties, etc. 

Are we missing any big events that you want to see? Feel free to suggest them to our Project Team! We also really value our Buddies’ input in events and want to hear feedback from them! Buddies are also responsible for holding a few Buddy Meetings, where the Buddy Group will get to know each other. The Buddies help answer any questions or concerns new students may have. 

They are typically recruited a few months prior to the start of reception through a Buddy Training. A Buddy Training is similar to a group interview, but uses various games and activities to assess if the applicant is what the Project Team is looking for. 

What’s in it for you? As a Buddy, you get the following: 

* Meet a bunch of new students and make many new friends
* Volunteer at the amazing events
* Get the possibility to receive a 0.2 GPA boost when applying to study abroad
* Attend a Buddy Osqvik
* Take part in a Thank You event exclusive for the Buddies. 

The requirements to receive the 0.2 GPA boost change during the semesters, but usually requires hosting Buddy Meetings and actively volunteering at a minimum number of events. Typically the Buddies go above and beyond these requirements because they have so much fun!
