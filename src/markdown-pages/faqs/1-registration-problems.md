      If you have problems registering yourself in our sign up system, please
      try the following things:


      1. Reload the page several times. The page looks correct if you also have
      a drop down menu where you can select your field of study. Wait up to 30
      seconds after loading the page, sometimes the drop down menu shows up
      after a few seconds.

      2. Use a different web browser


      If it still is not working try this:


      1. Do not use add ons

      2. Do not use vpn

      3. Do not use script blocker

      4. Do not use ad blockers
