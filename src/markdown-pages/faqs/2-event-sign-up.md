category: 2. Event Sign up
question:
  - description: >-
      We recommend to check the sign up page frequently since some students will
      unregister themselves from some events. As soon as someone unregisters
      themselves their spot becomes open in the system. Out of experience the
      closer it comes to the event the more people change their activity plans,
      but keep in mind that you usually can only unregister yourself two days
      before an event. 


      Please note that if you have already paid for an event there will be no
      refund. 


      You cannot join a full event, regardless of your motivation for it. The
      event limitations are in place due to restrictions in the size of the
      event location, available material (like Kayaks) and our own
      organisational capacity. If you join a full event without our explicit
      consent, we will remove you from the event. In severe cases we ban you
      from attending further events in the reception.

      We do not have a waiting list system yet (currently in the planning
      phase). Therefore, we recommend to check the sign up system regularly for
      open spots.
    title: 2.2. Can you put me on a waiting list for a specific event?

      Unfortunately this is not possible. We are aware that some events are very
      popular among new students but we cannot add more events. This is due to
      limitations in funding, the amount of people helping out, fire safety,
      booking of facilities, etc... Therefore, we are not able to offer more
      events than what we have right now in our event calendar :( Sometimes we
      might find a few more spots. In that case we will add them in the sign up
      system.

      2.3. Can you organize additional events, e.g. another Kayaking, Hiking or
      Osqvik?
